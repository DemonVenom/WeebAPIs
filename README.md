# WeebAPIs

Hello!


I created a website that effectively utilized APIs (specifically their JSON files) to programmatically update data on a website based on user input. Users can press buttons to receive a random quote from an anime show or receive a random quote from a catboy (uwu, owo, etc).


Visit the site using the link below:
